Touch Notifier Companion App
============================
The Touch Notifier Companion App is a simple app that receives data wirelessly and notifies a user if the Touch Sensor (https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/sensor/grove-buzzer) is being touched. The Touch Notifier node.js/IoT project sends this data to a connected client when running on a IoT platform such as a development board with the sensor connected. This sensor is included in the Grove Starter Kit Plus - IntelÂ® IoT Edition. For more information, go to https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/devkit.
